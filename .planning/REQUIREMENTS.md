# Requirements - Milestone v2.7: Path Execution & Dynamic Task Planning

Active requirements for high-performance multi-path chaining, dynamic trajectory switching, real-time diagnostic dashboarding, state-machine-driven task execution, and autonomous E2E simulator validation.

## Active Requirements

### Category: Multi-Path Trajectory Chaining
- [ ] **CHAIN-01 (Path Chaining)**: Parse and chain multiple sequential PathPlanner paths together, automatically matching target velocities and orientations at joint intersection boundaries.
- [ ] **CHAIN-02 (Dynamic Trajectory Switch)**: Intercept the active trajectory execution and dynamically switch to a new detour path in real-time when sensor costmap updates trigger a path blockage warning.

### Category: Telemetry & Diagnostic Dashboard
- [ ] **DIAG-01 (NT4 Diagnostics)**: Broadcast comprehensive path-following errors (lateral error, angular error, and progress percentage) to AdvantageScope and FTC Dashboard via the NetworkTables 4 (NT4) server.
- [ ] **DIAG-02 (Command Telemetry)**: Implement detailed actuator-level velocity, power, and state logs to trace execution latency between dispatch calls and motor responses.

### Category: State Machine Task Executor
- [ ] **EXEC-01 (Task State Machine)**: Create a pure, functional state machine executor that sequences physical robot tasks (e.g., intaking, elevating, shooting) synchronized with path markers.
- [ ] **EXEC-02 (Asynchronous Safety Interlocks)**: Prevent mechanical actions if localization values or EKF error covariance exceeds safe hardware thresholds.

### Category: Autonomous E2E Validation
- [ ] **VAL-01 (E2E Integration Sim)**: Execute fully automated multi-path autonomous runs in the physics simulator, verifying that all markers, state transitions, and dynamic detour paths execute successfully with zero collisions.

## Future Requirements (Deferred)
- **CHAIN-03 (Dynamic Spline Fit)**: Generate cubic/quintic splines dynamically on-device (deferred to v3.0).

## Out of Scope
- Integration with physical vision cameras (Limelight/VisionPortal) in the simulation suite — we mock raw vision frames directly.
