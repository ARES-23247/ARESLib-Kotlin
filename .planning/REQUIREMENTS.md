# Requirements - Milestone v2.9: Physical Deployment & Hardware Bridging

Active requirements for Milestone v2.9.

## Active Requirements

### Category: FRC Dual-Mode Drivetrain
* [ ] **FRC-SIM-01 (WPILib Real/Sim separation boundary)**: Abstract swerve execution in `ARESRobot.kt` to fully separate the physical `FRCSwerveHardwareIO` (using the CTRE Phoenix 6 `SwerveDrivetrain`) from the `dyn4j` physics simulation model, driven dynamically by standard `RobotBase.isReal()` and `RobotBase.isSimulation()` toggles.

### Category: FTC On-Device Trajectory Loading
* [ ] **FTC-PATH-01 (Dynamic File Loader)**: Build an Android-compatible dynamic path loader class that scans and reads PathPlanner `.path` JSON files directly from the Control Hub's local filesystem (`/sdcard/FIRST/`) or app assets at runtime, eliminating hardcoded JSON string templates inside source files.

### Category: EKF Physical Hardware Integration
* [ ] **FTC-EKF-01 (EKF Hardware Pipeline Wiring)**: Refactor `ARESMecanumTeleOp.java` and `ARESMecanumAuto.kt` to pipe raw, high-resolution measurements from physical pinpoint odometry (`PinpointOdometryIO`) and vision cameras directly to the redux EKF store as state updates.
* [ ] **FTC-EKF-02 (Holonomic Trajectory Coupling)**: Direct the `HolonomicDriveController` to track paths using the globally filtered EKF `estimatedPose` instead of raw, un-fused wheel integration.

### Category: Safety & Outlier Gating
* [ ] **FTC-EKF-03 (Chi-Squared Outlier Gating)**: Implement a mathematical **Mahalanobis Distance ($\chi^2$) Outlier Gate** in the EKF's vision update method to calculate target residuals relative to combined state and camera covariances, instantly discarding severe tracking glitches (e.g. reflections or false visual targets).
* [ ] **FTC-EKF-04 (Drift Recovery Teleportation)**: Implement a consecutive-rejection recovery mechanism that snaps the EKF state directly to high-confidence vision frames if the robot has slowly drifted over a long duration and accumulated uncorrectable dead-reckoning offset.

### Category: Diagnostics & Calibration
* [ ] **DIAG-01 (On-Device Calibrations)**: Implement driver-centric calibration triggers on the gamepads to manually reset gyro orientation, update starting pinpoint boundaries, and zero field coordinates.
* [ ] **DIAG-02 (Covariance Ellipse Telemetry)**: Broadcast real-time EKF estimation error covariances ($P$) as standard deviation coordinates to AdvantageScope and FTC Dashboard for student diagnostic reviews.

## Future Requirements (Deferred)
- Multi-camera 3D triangulation (Limelight megaTag2) — Deferred to v3.0 until single-camera EKF fusion is fully tuned and proven on physical FTC/FRC robots.

---

## Out of Scope
- Direct firmware modifications to the goBILDA Pinpoint computer — the library will interact strictly through the official public driver interfaces.
