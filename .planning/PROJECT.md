# ARESLib-Kotlin

## What This Is
ARESLib-Kotlin is a foundational, cross-platform (FTC and FRC) robotics library built with Kotlin 1.9+. It provides a highly performant, functional, and immutable state-driven core. By leveraging a Redux-style state store and an "IO Layer" pattern, it fully decouples pure control logic (such as Swerve, Mecanum, and Differential kinematics, and PathPlanner trajectory following) from hardware SDKs, ensuring 100% offline testability.

## Core Value
100% pure, immutable, and testable control logic completely isolated from hardware SDKs, allowing the exact same mathematical core to run flawlessly on both FTC Control Hubs and FRC RoboRIOs.

### Active
- [ ] Planning next milestone... — v2.8

## Current Milestone: v2.8 (Planning)

**Goal:** Plan next milestone requirements and pathing targets for real FTC and FRC deployment, optimization, and advanced autonomous enhancements.

**Target features:**
- TBD during next milestone requirements phase.

### Out of Scope
- Mutable internal state within subsystems — breaks testability and the functional paradigm.
- AdvantageKit `@AutoLog` or KAPT usage — drastically increases build times and breaks cross-platform compatibility on Android.
- `com.qualcomm` or `edu.wpi` imports in pure logic files — tightly couples the logic to specific platforms.

## Context
- The library must be highly performant on the Android 9+ ART generational garbage collector, demanding minimized heap allocations within the main control loop by relying on short-lived immutable objects or value classes.
- For FRC, strict synchronization with the CANivore bus is required for zero odometry jitter.
- The project targets Kotlin 1.9+ features and standardizes on primitive-driven state handling.

## Constraints
- **Architecture**: Redux-style — State must be immutable and transitioned strictly via Actions and pure Reducers.
- **Garbage Collection**: Android ART GC constraints — Avoid heavy allocations in `opModeIsActive()` or `robotPeriodic()`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Code must build and run on both Android (FTC) and RoboRIO (FRC).
- **Tooling**: Pure data struct serialization for AdvantageScope rather than annotation generation.

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pure Functional Core | Maximizes testability and allows sharing 100% of mathematical logic between FTC and FRC. | ✓ Good |
| No KAPT / `@AutoLog` | Speeds up build times and ensures Android/RoboRIO cross-compatibility. | ✓ Good |
| Redux-style State Store | Centralizes all robot state, enabling time-travel debugging and unified logging. | ✓ Good |
| Chronological Vision Replay | Solves asynchronous pipeline latency by rewind/replay of historical odometry entries in EKF. | ✓ Good |
| Path Projection Side-Locking | Locks chosen detour side based on path progress vector projection to prevent oscillation. | ✓ Good |
| Target-in-Valley Candidate | Integrates direct target heading as detour candidate when unblocked to eliminate hysteresis. | ✓ Good |
| Stack-Based FSM Preemption | Allows mechanical subsystems to preempt and prioritize state transitions based on path events. | ✓ Good |
| Microsecond Action Replay | Structured JSONL telemetry logs write microsecond-accurate physical outputs to enable deterministic offline simulation replay. | ✓ Good |
| Path Progress Floor Velocity | Enforces a nominal floor velocity of 1.5 m/s in simulations when progress is driven strictly by target trajectory speed to prevent standstill profiles. | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
