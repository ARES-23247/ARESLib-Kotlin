/**
 * Synchronous Redux-style state container for robot state transitions.
 *
 * Reductions are serialized by this instance, and [state] is published through a volatile
 * reference so readers on telemetry or simulator threads see the latest immutable snapshot.
 * [actionListener] and subscribers run synchronously on the dispatching thread; subscriber
 * callbacks run after the store lock is released. A slow or throwing callback therefore affects
 * its caller but cannot leave the reducer half-applied.
 *
 * Callers should normally dispatch from the robot loop to keep action ordering deterministic.
 * Concurrent dispatches are safe from lost updates, but their ordering is whichever caller enters
 * the monitor first.
 *
 * @param initialState State visible before the first dispatch.
 * @param reducer Pure transition function. It must not mutate [RobotState] or perform hardware IO.
