/**
 * A cursor-based replay session for time-travel debugging.
 *
 * Loads a recorded action log (JSONL from [ActionLogger]) and provides
 * step-by-step navigation through the state history. States are lazily
 * computed and cached via sparse checkpoints for efficient random-access
 * scrubbing without requiring O(n) storage of every intermediate state.
 *
 * **Checkpoint Strategy**: A [RobotState] snapshot is cached every
 * [CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL] actions. Seeking to any index requires at most
 * [CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL] reducer applications from the nearest cached
 * checkpoint, giving O(1) amortized cost for sequential scrubbing and
 * O([CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL]) worst-case cost for random seeks.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val session = ActionReplaySession.load(logFile)
 * session.seekToIndex(100)  // Jump to action #100
 * val state = session.currentState
 * session.stepForward()     // Advance one action
 * session.stepBackward()    // Rewind one action
 * ```
 *
 * @property actions The ordered list of deserialized actions from the log file.
 * @property reducer The pure reducer function used to compute state transitions.
 * @property initialState The initial [RobotState] before any actions are applied.
