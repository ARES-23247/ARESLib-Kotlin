/**
 * Mock of `android.os.Build` for desktop simulation and unit tests.
 *
 * The real `android.jar` from the Android SDK contains stub implementations that throw
 * `RuntimeException("Stub!")` at runtime. Several third-party libraries access
 * `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` during class initialization to decide which Java features are available.
 * This mock shadows the SDK stub when running desktop unit tests and simulation.
