# ARESLib-Kotlin

ARESLib-Kotlin is the shared Kotlin foundation for the ARES FTC, FRC, simulator, and analytics projects. It provides geometry, estimation, control, path planning, immutable robot state, hardware abstractions, telemetry, and local log transport. Season repositories supply the robot-specific hardware bindings and orchestration.

## Repository structure

| Module | Purpose | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | State, reducers, geometry, EKF localization, controllers, safety, pathing, sequencer, NT4, telemetry, and logging | Kotlin/JVM libraries only |
| `codegen` | Project, controls, autonomous, and subsystem Kotlin generation CLI | `core` |
| `ftc-mocks` | Desktop implementations of the FTC and Android APIs used by library code | `core` |
| `ftc-hardware` | FTC SDK adapters, mecanum robot base classes, Pinpoint, Limelight, cached hardware, and power management | `core`; mocks for compilation/tests |
| `frc-hardware` | WPILib and vendor adapters, swerve robot base classes, Limelight, telemetry, and power management | `core` |
| `simulator` | Dyn4j desktop physics, virtual driver station, OpMode runner, replay, and NT4 bridge | `core`, `ftc-hardware`, `ftc-mocks` |
| `simulator-runtime-*` | Windows, Linux, or macOS JNI/LWJGL runtime selected by the consumer | `simulator` |
| `ares-bom` | One version constraint for every published ARES artifact | all published modules |

The important dependency rule is that platform and season code depend inward on `core`; `core` never imports FTC or WPILib APIs.

       ARES-FTC / ARES-FRC / ARES-Analytics
                   consume published modules
```

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for package ownership, the robot loop, and extension points.

## Requirements

- JDK 17
- The checked-in Gradle Wrapper
- Windows PowerShell examples below use `gradlew.bat`; use `./gradlew` on macOS or Linux
- WPILib/vendor dependencies are resolved by Gradle when building `frc-hardware`

## Build and test

Run commands from this repository root:

```powershell
# Compile all production and test Kotlin sources
.\gradlew.bat compileKotlin compileTestKotlin

# Run all module tests
.\gradlew.bat test

# Run focused suites
.\gradlew.bat :core:test
.\gradlew.bat :ftc-hardware:test
.\gradlew.bat :frc-hardware:test
.\gradlew.bat :simulator:test

# Build the complete Maven bundle in an isolated repository under build/
.\gradlew.bat apiCheck publishReleaseValidation
```

Normal FTC, FRC, and Analytics builds consume immutable releases from Maven Central. To test an unpublished library change against a sibling consumer without composite substitution, publish the isolated bundle and pass its repository explicitly:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat publishReleaseValidation
cd ..\ARES-FTC
.\gradlew.bat test -ParesRepository="..\ARESLib-Kotlin\build\release-repository"
```

All artifacts use the verified `org.aresfirst.ares` Maven namespace and one version:

| Module | Coordinates |
|---|---|
| BOM | `org.aresfirst.ares:ares-bom:5.0.0` |
| Core | `org.aresfirst.ares:core` |
| Code generation | `org.aresfirst.ares:codegen` |
| FTC | `org.aresfirst.ares:ftc-hardware`, `org.aresfirst.ares:ftc-mocks` |
| FRC | `org.aresfirst.ares:frc-hardware` |
| Simulator | `org.aresfirst.ares:simulator` |
| Simulator natives | `org.aresfirst.ares:simulator-runtime-{windows,linux,macos}` |

Consumer builds pin the BOM version with the `aresVersion` Gradle property. Source substitution is an explicit library-development option: `-ParesUseSiblingLib=true`.

## Run the simulator

```powershell
# Starts the simulator in OpMode discovery/server mode
.\gradlew.bat :simulator:run

# Pass a season OpMode and run without the Swing driver-station window
.\gradlew.bat :simulator:run -PappArgs="--headless --opmode org.example.MyOpMode"
```

The simulator serves NT4 on port `5810` and the local log browser/API on port `5002`. A season repository normally adds the real OpMode classes to the simulator runtime; the library by itself provides the physics and runner infrastructure.

## Non-negotiable contracts

- Coordinates are meters and headings are radians, CCW-positive: `0 = +X`, `pi/2 = +Y`.
- Odometry deltas passed into `PoseEstimator` are robot-local SE(2) displacements.
- Pinpoint heading polarity is corrected once in `PinpointIO`; do not negate it downstream.
- Limelight target-space yaw is `-robotPoseTargetSpace.rotation.y`; `rotation.z` is not robot yaw.
- Library time comes from `RobotClock`, never directly from wall-clock APIs.
- Hardware is read once per loop into cached input objects; output and state getters do not read devices.
- High-frequency update, sampling, and steering paths must not allocate.
- Robots do not upload logs to cloud services. ARES Analytics pulls logs over the local network and performs cloud sync from the laptop.
- NT4 topic names are normalized without a leading slash, and an announced topic's type does not change during its lifetime.

The rationale and edge cases are documented in [Math and coordinate contracts](docs/math-and-coordinate-contracts.md) and [Telemetry and logging](docs/telemetry-and-logging.md).
